# Annie's Gamer Gauntlet

[Annie's Gamer Gauntlet](https://starboyceleste.github.io/annie/) is a small page I created to help a friend stay motivated to complete full-length story games. The idea was to provide a structured and visually engaging way for them to track their progress, set goals, and ultimately experience more games.

The page features a dynamic interface where users can toggle between tracking playtime and in-game checkpoints. It displays game progress in categories like "In-Progress," "Finished," and "Planned," and updates dynamically from a manually maintained Google Sheets data source.

The list is maintained by her Twitch moderators and community members:
